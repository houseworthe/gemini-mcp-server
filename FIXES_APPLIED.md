# Fixes Applied to Gemini MCP Server

## Summary

This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve CI pipeline issues in the Gemini MCP Server repository.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Ruff Linting Errors in `server.py`

**Fixed:**
- Line 397: Changed unused function argument `frame` to `_frame` in signal_handler
- Line 477: Changed bare `except:` clause to `except Exception:`
- Fixed import sorting to comply with Ruff's import ordering rules
- Removed trailing whitespace from multiple blank lines
- Added missing newline at end of file

### 2. Ruff Linting Errors in `tests/test_server.py`

**Fixed:**
- Rewrote entire test file to match the actual server implementation (was testing against a different API)
- Fixed import sorting
- Removed unused imports (`json`, `AsyncMock`, `Response`)
- Fixed unused variable `response` by removing the assignment
- Removed trailing whitespace from multiple blank lines
- Added missing newline at end of file

### 3. Test Import Issues

**Fixed:**
- Added `sys.path` manipulation to allow tests to import the server module
- Changed from importing non-existent `google.generativeai` to mocking `requests` library
- Updated all test cases to work with the HTTP-based implementation

### 4. Black Formatting

**Applied:**
- Ran Black formatter on both `server.py` and `tests/test_server.py` to ensure consistent code formatting
- All code now follows PEP 8 style guidelines with Black's opinionated formatting

### 5. Project Configuration

**Updated `pyproject.toml`:**
- Moved Ruff configuration to the new `[tool.ruff.lint]` section format
- Added `extend-exclude` to ignore duplicate files in subdirectories
- This resolved deprecation warnings about top-level linter settings

## Test Results

All 17 tests now pass successfully with 58% code coverage. The uncovered code is primarily:
- Signal handling and main server loop (requires actual stdin/stdout interaction)
- Error handling paths that are difficult to trigger in unit tests

## Dependencies Installed

To run the tests locally, ensure you have:
```bash
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio pytest-cov pytest-mock ruff black
```

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run linting
ruff check server.py tests/

# Run formatting check
black --check server.py tests/

# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

All CI checks should now pass successfully.
